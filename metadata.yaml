description: She glanced over her shoulder as she put the question, and there nearly
  followed an accident, for Amy was running, and the look back caused her to stumble.
  Betty, who was racing beside her, just managed to save her chum from a bad fall.
  All the girls were running--running as though their lives depended on their speed.
  Luckily they wore short, walking skirts, which did not hinder free movement, and
  they really made good speed.
